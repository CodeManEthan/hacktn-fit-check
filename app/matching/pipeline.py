"""Ranking donors for one request, in two stages that must never merge.

Stage one is compatibility: `check_fit` decides whether a device can work at
this clinic at all. It is a predicate, it calls no model, and its answer is
the only thing allowed to remove an offer from the list.

Stage two is allocation: among the devices that work, which donor is nearest.
It calls no model either.

There is deliberately no combined score. A device that cannot work does not
become usable by being close, so distance is never allowed to outrank a
failed check, and a short distance can never buy a blocker off.
